## 1. What I implemented this lecture
- I implemented a semantic HTML structure for my portfolio page.
- I added meaningful sections such as header, navigation, main content, and footer.
- I included a portfolio section with images, links, and an embedded video using semantic elements.

## 2. Semantic decisions I made (REQUIRED)

Explain at least **three semantic choices** you made in your HTML.

### Decision 1
- Element(s) used: <header> and <h1>
- Where in the page: At the top of the page
- Why this element is semantically correct: The <header> element represents introductory content for the page, and <h1> is used for the main title (my name). This clearly defines the identity and purpose of the page for both users and screen readers.

### Decision 2
- Element(s) used: <nav> with <ul> and <a>
- Where in the page: Directly after the header
- Why this element is semantically correct: The <nav> element is specifically meant for navigation links. Using it instead of a <div> helps assistive technologies understand that the links are used to navigate between sections of the page.

### Decision 3
- Element(s) used: <section>, <figure>, and <figcaption>
- Where in the page: Inside the portfolio section in the main content
- Why this element is semantically correct:<section> groups related content with a clear topic, while <figure> and <figcaption> are used to associate images and videos with descriptive text. This improves content meaning and accessibility.

## 3. Accessibility considerations
- What accessibility features did you include?
  I included a skip link that allows users to jump directly to the main content.
  I used alternative text (alt) for all images.
  I followed correct heading hierarchy (h1 to h2).
- How do they improve usability?

## 4. What I learned
- I learned how to use semantic HTML elements to structure a webpage properly.
- I understood how semantic elements improve accessibility and readability.
- I learned the importance of correct heading hierarchy and meaningful markup.

## 5. What I still need to improve
- I want to practice structuring larger webpages using semantic HTML.

## 6. Notes about AI usage (if any)
- Tool used: Visual studio, ChatGPT
- What I accepted as-is: The overall HTML structure and semantic explanations.
- What I modified manually: links, and project content.
